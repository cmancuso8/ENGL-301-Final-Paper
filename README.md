# ENGL-301-Final-Paper

Here's (almost) all of the code and analysis I attempted for the final project for ENGL 301. While it did not pan out as expected, I was glad for the opportunity to explore these novels on such an extended scale! 

The steps in the process go 1, 2, 3, and each represents me attempting to work with a different data set of novels that could be used. While none fully worked in the end, I certainly learned many valuable lessons along the way!
